// This would preferrably be emulated while accomodating the use of Wallclock Mode with the proper settings (1440 minutes per year) as "realism mode" is designed for the "Long Haul" GRF-heavy multiplayer server.
 // All this "realism" is entirely optional, feel free to remove or change the values as you find is most fitting of your creation! That said, having a parameter to support this would be nice! ^_^

 // Costs are meant to be played with inflation OFF and Wallclock mode set to 1440 minutes per year, equivalent to 90 irl seconds per 6 in-game hours or 4 irl minutes per in-game day.
 // As the default railtype's standardized equivalent, SAAN is the "anchor" by which the "realistic" values are judged by, though minimum cost is also determined by maintenance for SAcN (1 bread loaves per realday-gameyear), SAbN (2 bread loaves per nearrealweek-gameyear) and SAaN (3 bread loaves per nearrealweek-gameyear). Ideally there would be smaller increments, but sadly there is not, so the minimum cost is skewed above reality.

 // Base costs are linked to energy via US bread price differences between 2000 and a given introduction year.
 // One loaf in the year 2000 was $1.00 USD on average, while one Pound Sterling was worth $1.65 USD in 2000. One loaf in 2024 was $2.00, while one loaf in 1828 (The earliest standard gauge railway for steam engines) was $0.055 USD (yes, five-and-a-half cents) so that should be taken into account when adjusting the construction and maintenance costs.
 // The exchange rate should be ¤1 loaves = £1 (as an ARBITRARY number) with inflation OFF (as the true scale of calories to money cannot be properly assessed with fluctuating costs)
 // In real life, a watt uses a capital W as its symbol, but here I'm using the symbol for the Ohm. Assume Joules/Watts/Volts/Ohms/Amps are the same thing, because the Amp's definition is dependent on the Ohm (electrical resistance), which has a value dependent on the value of the Volt (electrical potential), which in turn is determined by the Watt (energy per second), which is finally derived from the Joule (energy in SI units). 1 kilocalorie is equal to ¤4184 under this system. Any practical differences between Joules, Watts, Volts and Ohms are mostly irrelevant to this currency system.
 // The system assumes one slice of bread is ~¢100 food calories/kilocalories (1,000 thermal calories = 1 food calorie), that a sandwich meal is 2.5 slices of bread (~¢250 kcal) and 20 slices (~¢2000 kcal) make a loaf, and implies that ¢3300 kilocalories (roughly, 2006 kcal times 1.65 equals 3309.9 to be precise) equals the amount of kilocalories (large calories/U.S. food calories) worth of white bread that could be bought by $1.65 USD in 2000 (equal to ~£1.00 on average at the time). Costs can then be calculated with energy instead of currency. One minimum-price meal (grocery store prices, not restaurant) is equivalent to .15 cents (2.5 slices of bread) in 2000 and thus $0.15 USD was the cost of a sandwich or slice of cake from your fridge in 2000.
 // Unfortunately, making ¢3300 kilocalories = $1 is impossible because the dollar is hardcoded to $2 = £1, and the Pound Sterling value of a currency made using the game settings cannot be fractional. Additionally, even if this discrepancy were to be fixed, this would cause the minimum possible monthly maintenance cost to become 3300 kcal, despite the minimum construction cost being smaller but the intended construction cost being 10 times as much as maintenance. Hopefully this is corrected someday, but it's unlikely so make sure the maintenance cost is as low as possible (the default of 1 is best) and settle for an even more abstracted system as follows...
 // An example of an abstract system was my original "₿" idea for use with TEST; Using the Bitcoin symbol for "breadslices" (1 breadslice = 100 food calories or 100,000 scientific calories) that are a 20th of a loaf of bread. This means that a slice (₿1) is 5 cents in 2000 (the base date for this system), half a cent in 1828 (the first steam locomotive railroads/railways), and 10 cents in 2024 (the year this GRF was made).
 // The minimum maintenance cost of 50 units (£3.02 GBP in non-arbitrary/irl, "£1" in arbitrary/game unit) in maintenance per real minute/game hour per tile being equal to 2.5 loaves of bread (25 slices) is unavoidable, so an even smaller unit must be used. In the future, breadslices could work for a more "user-readable" experience if modifications are made to the handling of costs.
